Our web application aims to revolutionize waste management in residential societies by providing an AI-based solution for waste identification from images. Users can upload images of waste collected in their society, and our system will classify the segmented objects into different waste types using pre-trained vision models. The application facilitates proper waste segregation by enabling users to track and measure their waste disposal practices. Additionally, the system offers gamification features to incentivize users for effective waste segregation. Through a dashboard, users can access descriptive statistics, such as the average percentage of waste types detected and the number of waste types identified.
