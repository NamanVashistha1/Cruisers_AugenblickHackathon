Our web application aims to revolutionize waste management in residential societies by providing an AI-based solution for waste identification from images. Users can upload images of waste collected in their society, and our system will classify the segmented objects into different waste types using pre-trained vision models. The application facilitates proper waste segregation by enabling users to track and measure their waste disposal practices. Additionally, the system offers gamification features to incentivize users for effective waste segregation. Through a dashboard, users can access descriptive statistics, such as the average percentage of waste types detected and the number of waste types identified.
User Story: As a member of a residential society committed to sustainable living, I rely on the web application to streamline waste management processes. By uploading images of waste items, I receive instant feedback on the waste types and proper disposal methods. The gamification feature motivates me to enhance waste segregation practices by rewarding accurate classifications and reducing specific waste types. With the dashboard, I can monitor our society's progress in waste management, making data-driven decisions to achieve our sustainability goals. Overall, the application empowers me to actively participate in waste reduction efforts and create a cleaner environment for future generations.
